In different to the classification and detection, the challenge of AQA is it requires the model to predict fine-grained scores from videos that describe the same action. 

The research funding are as follow:
Our AQA model results moderately correlate with the ground truth labels for interaction and play domains. However, compared with interaction and play, the $p$ value for communication and stereotype domains only obtained a weak correlation based on the result. 

Although we do not observe strong correlations with p-values greater than 0.6, the DREAM dataset is not specifically designed for the AQA tasks. Even though specialist clinicians assess the ADOS scores, the assessment subcategories are not strictly correlated with the behavioural data, and the dataset does not provide detailed sub-category assessment item scores for each of the four domains.
